# The Central Limit Theorem and confidence intervals

In this section we are going to learn the following:

1.  Plotting and using ggplot. I commonly use ggplot, although still use "baseR" quite often to plot. But the reality is that the ggplot package **is probably the best tool and package to plot in R.** We will learn to make plots using ggplot and we will use it throughout the course.
2.  Data simulation.
3.  The central theorem and confidence intervals
4.  Introduction to linear models

This is a "longer" assignment. But the next one will be shorter. You can take as long as you need on it ðŸ˜ƒ

You can download the quarto document (from Canvas) and use it to answer the questions, copy code, modify code, etc.

# Remember!

::: callout-note
If you are comfortable with R basics, you can write the code for this exercise directly into Quarto. To add extra code chunks, write this symbols: \`\`\`{r}, if you are still not comfortable with R, I recommend for the time being you open a new file and copy and paste the code there, and run it. You can submit this as a qmd file or as an r-script. Whatever you feel more comfortable with at the moment (.qmd + .html preferred)

You can also go to insert \> executable cell \> R and that should insert an r chunk

## Why is my data not loading?

Make sure you download the data file, and also save the quarto file you're working on in the class folder!
